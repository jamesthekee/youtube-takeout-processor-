# youtube-takeout-processor-
Two python scripts to take a bunch of html files containing youtube watch history and dump it into a sqlite3 database file

beware there may be some unfixed uncommented spaghetti code ahead, but feel free to have a cheeky look

How to use
- Download your google takeout (u only need youtube history) and extract them
- Do this every few months just in case. I have found that they typically store history for
about a year and a half
- Store the entire takeout file in the folder takeouts
- run the datacompiler.py
